# flying-to-fly
first stab at making a tool to connect acrobats on layovers

users can create a profile after running the main interface 'flying_to_fly.py' 

The airport dictionary has a database of 3 letter airport codes. The database.txt file is a rudimentary implementation of storing user credentials and associated information to be read by the script. This was my first python project.
